Meta-Rouge
==========

This project is meant to grow with my own abilities.

The goal of this project is to create a rouge like where in each play though provides one with a higher level of re-play-ability.

TODO:
1. [ ] create a simple rouge-like 
   - Have each portion have a well designed interface (they will be used later)
   - keep in mine which portions of the game will be easily modified later
2. create a menu system for starting the game.
3. make the first module (enabled by default or a compile flag)
4. have the module toggel-able in the menu system
